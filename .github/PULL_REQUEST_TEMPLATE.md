Hi!

Thank you for making an admin request on this repo. We strive to make a decision

Cheers and thank you for contributing to conda-forge!

## Guidelines for marking packages as broken:

* We prefer to patch the repo data (see [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-repodata-patches-feedstock))
  instead of marking packages as broken. This alternative workflow makes environments more reproducible.
* Packages with requirements/metadata that are too strict but otherwise work are
  not technically broken and should not be marked as such.
* Packages with missing metadata can be marked as broken on a temporary basis
  but should be patched in the repo data and be marked unbroken later.
* In some cases where the number of users of a package is small or it is used by
  the maintainers only, we can allow packages to be marked broken more liberally.
* We (`conda-forge/core`) try to make a decision on these requests within 24 hours.

What will happen when a package is marked broken?

* Our bots will add the `broken` label to the package. The `main` label will remain on the package and this is normal.
* Our bots will rebuild our repodata patches to remove this package from the repodata.
* In a few hours after the `anaconda.org` CDN picks up the new patches, you will no longer be able to install the package from the `main` channel.
